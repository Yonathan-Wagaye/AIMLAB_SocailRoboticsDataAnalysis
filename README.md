# AIMLAB ADHD Diagnostic Analysis Using Social Robots

## Project Overview 
This repository contains the data and code for analyzing the impact of distractions caused by a social robot on the performance of participants engaged in attention-demanding tasks. The project aims to explore potential diagnostic methods for ADHD by observing behavioral responses to external stimuli provided by the robot.

## Data set Description
The data collected in this study includes:

* Raw Gaze Data: Records the x, y coordinates and duration of gaze points, capturing where and how long participants focused during the task.
* Response Times: Documents each response, detailing the time taken and whether the response was correct or incorrect, which helps in measuring task performance.
* Distraction Events: Logs specific times when distractions (singing, sneezing, yawning) occurred during the session to correlate with changes in task performance.
* Random Elements Data: Describes the sequence of shapes and colors presented during the task, providing context for each participant's responses.
